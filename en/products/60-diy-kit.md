## Hardware

In order to pursue the ultimate performance, we gave up the cost-effective route and adopted higher-performance components to achieve ultra-low latency.
With the combination of high-performance hardware and unique algorithms,
we have achieved accurate and stable detection of the real physical 0.1-4.0mm travel while ensuring low latency.
Therefore, all software functions can be implemented without sacrificing performance.

- The distance detected by the keyboard basically corresponds to the physical distance
- True physical 0.1-4.0mm key travel, no hidden dead zone; ultra-high resolution 0.05mm (when adjusting settings, adjust in steps of 0.05mm)
- The hardware is pushed as fast as possible, no extra software debounce time
- 8000Hz USB polling rate
- For ultimate performance, no RGB, only CapsLock indicator
- The foundation of the hardware is good enough that any software function can be implemented without affecting performance

## Software

- Modify key mapping, settings, etc. on the web page; all settings are saved in the keyboard, no need to install any so-called "driver" software
- Supports firmware upgrade, with just few clicks
- Support RT (if there are new functional requirements, this can be achieved through firmware updates)
- All settings can be modified individually for a key
- Full keyboard key remap, support layer, support long press and click to correspond to different behaviors (similar to QMK's LT and MT)

## Layout

60 or 64.
Also supports left Shift splitting, Backspace splitting, ISO enter, and space splitting.
Note that the split spaces can only be arranged in the order of 2.25 2.75 1.25 due to hole position issues.
